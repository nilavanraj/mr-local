1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,720
Ezra Klein:  why don't you describe for me as vividly as you can

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,020
what it is you're worried about. what it is
nightmare scenario looks like?

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,060
Bill Gates: Fortunately, there's very few things
and most of them are very low

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,170
probability

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,990
some big volcanic explosion

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,789
A giant earthquake, asteroid

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,800
At least in the nuclear case

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,090
you gotta say we take it quite seriously.
We budget a lot of money, have a lot of

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,269
people who think about nuclear deterrence,

10
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:34,601
I'm very glad that works being done and

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,730
I rate the chance of a nuclear war in my
lifetime has being fairly low.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,820
I rate the chance of a widespread
epidemic far worse than Ebola

13
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,169
in my lifetime as well over 50 percent.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,740
If we look at the 20th Century, and we look at the death chart

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,590
of the 20th Century, I think everybody
would say oh yeah there must be a spike

16
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,100
from World War I

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,410
and you know sure enough there it is like
25 million

18
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,560
and I must be a big spike for World War II,
and there it is – like 65 million

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,610
but then you'll see this other spike
that

20
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,410
is as large as World War II, right
after World War I – and most people, a lot

21
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,470
of people say what?  Wait a minute – what was that?

22
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,300
There's two kinds of flus:

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,300
There's flus that spread between humans very effectively

24
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,910
and there's flus that kill lots of
people. And those two properties have

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,640
only been combined

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,900
I into a widespread flu

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,020
once in history.  That is Spanish Flu.

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,480
We have no idea where it
came from  – it's called the Spanish flu

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,720
because the Spanish press was the freest,

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,880
they were the first to talk openly about it.

31
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,160
and so in the annals of epidemic
history that's the big event.

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,740
I funded a disease modeling group that
uses computer simulation

33
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,030
and that work has been phenomenal in
helping us

34
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,950
target our polio eradication resources
– which parts of nigeria should we

35
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,619
work harder on? And it's very natural if
you have a group like that to say hey

36
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:13,470
look at something like the Spanish flu
in the modern day.

37
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,870
Health systems are far better and so you'd think, hey that wouldn't be very bad.

38
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,220
Well, we tried it –  and there are some assumptions we had to make – but what we showed is that the

39
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,520
force of infection, because modern
transport

40
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,620
which be compared to 1918 is over fifty
times as great,

41
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,440
if you get something like the [Spanish] flu
and you look at that map

42
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,060
of how within days it's basically

43
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,230
in all urban centers of the entire globe

44
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,930
That is very, uh, eye-opening.

45
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,100
that didn't happen with Spanish flu in
the past.

46
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,160
The opportunity in did do more than just

47
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,489
let it run its course is really only in
the last decade

48
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,280
basically when you talk about drugs, you can talk about small molecules or you can talk about

49
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,760
these

50
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,530
complex biological protein like things
which is a subclass called antibodies

51
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,750
antibodies are the molecules the immune
system naturally builds to attack disease

52
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,810
Today, the idea that somebody says oh
here's an antibody

53
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,819
make a lot of it made it very quickly
that's right on the cutting edge.

54
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,700
and the Ebola epidemic showed me that
we're not ready

55
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,260
for a serious epidemic. An epidemic that
would be more infectious and would spread faster

56
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,219
than Ebola did. This is the greatest
risk

57
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:40,879
have a huge tragedy. This is the most
likely thing by far

58
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,040
to kill over 10 million excess people

59
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,859
in a year. We don't need to invest nearly
what we do

60
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:51,459
in military preparedness. this is
something where

61
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,109
less than a billion a year on R&D,
medical surveillance,

62
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:00,790
on standby personnel, cross-training the
military so they can play a role in

63
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,949
terms of all the logistics here. This can
be done

64
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:07,090
and we may not get many more warnings
like this one

65
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,599
to to say okay it's a pretty modest
investment

66
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,540
to avoid something that, really, in terms
of the human condition would be a

67
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,389
gigantic setback.
